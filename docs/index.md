# Factions<small>UUID</small>

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have the latest version from the [resource page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsuuid.1035/).

This documentation is written with version 4.0 in mind.

## Translation

You can translate most FactionsUUID messages to your own language. There are two files:

* `plugins/FactionsUUID/config/translations.conf`
    * Modern translations in MiniMessage format.
    * Some contain placeholders that look like this: `<name>`
* `plugins/FactionsUUID/config/lang.yml`
    * Legacy translations in legacy color format.
    * Some contain placeholders that look like this: `%s`
    * This file will be, over time, slowly migrated to the newer translation file, and items will *not* be converted over.
